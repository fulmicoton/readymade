Readymade
=====================================

[Readymade](http://poulejapon.github.com/readymade/) is a development server for webprogrammers.


In addition to static files, some of your assets (JavaScript, CSS, Images, ...) have to be compiled before being served to your browser.

Readymade typically replaces the **-watch** solution, or the plugin in your web framework by a simple generic solution for all of your assets. It handles creating new directories, and chains of compilation (e.g. if want my coffeescript to be compiled, and then minified).

Readymade makes it easy to have those compiled on the fly 
when requested and when your source files have been modified.
